This lab focuses on configuring and managing shell profiles in a Linux environment, which are critical for customizing and managing the user environment. Shell profiles are used to set environment variables, aliases, functions, and other configurations that affect the userâ€™s shell behavior. In this lab, you will work with various shell profile files like .bashrc, .bash_profile, /etc/profile, and /etc/bash.bashrc.

#### Objective:

â€¢	Understand how to manage user-specific and system-wide environment settings using shell profiles.

â€¢	Learn how to configure environment variables, customize the command prompt, and define aliases and functions.

â€¢	Automate configurations for system-wide settings and user-specific preferences.
Lab Tasks:
________________________________________
#### 1. Task: Understanding Shell Profile Files

####	Objective: 
Learn about the different profile files that control the shell environment in Linux.

â€¢	Files to Explore:

    1.	/etc/profile:

     #	This file is used for system-wide environment settings. It is executed for login shells.
    
    2.	~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile:
     
     #	These files are user-specific and executed for login shells. .bash_profile is preferred in Bash, while .profile is used in other shells.
    
    3.	~/.bashrc:
     
     #	Executed for non-login interactive shells. It's typically used to define aliases, functions, and environment variables.
    
    4.	/etc/bash.bashrc:
     
     #	System-wide Bash settings executed for every interactive non-login shell.

####	Task:

1.	Use the cat command to examine the contents of the /etc/profile, ~/.bash_profile, and ~/.bashrc files.

2.	Learn the difference between login and non-login shells.

3.	Check if the files exist, and create them if they donâ€™t.

####	Outcome: 
Understand how different profile files work and how they influence shell behavior.

#### 2. Task: Setting Up Environment Variables

####	Objective: Learn to set environment variables for user-specific or system-wide configuration.
####	Task:
    
    1.	Set Environment Variables for a Single User:
     
     #	Add environment variables like PATH, JAVA_HOME, or EDITOR in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc.
     
     # 	Example: Add export PATH=$PATH:/opt/custom/bin to append a custom directory to the PATH.

    2.	Set System-Wide Environment Variables:
     
     #	Add environment variables to /etc/profile for all users.
     
     #	Example: export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java to set the Java home directory globally.
    
    3.	Make Changes Effective:
     
     #	After editing the profile files, run source ~/.bash_profile or source ~/.bashrc to apply changes.
    
    4.	Verify Changes:
     
     #	Use echo $VARIABLE_NAME to verify that the environment variable is set correctly.
####	Outcome: 
Understand how to set environment variables for individual users or globally.

#### 3. Task: Customizing the Bash Prompt

####	Objective: 
Customize the bash prompt (PS1) to improve the user experience.

####	Task:

    1.	Modify the PS1 Variable:
     
     #	Open ~/.bashrc and customize the PS1 variable to change the command prompt.
     
     #	Example: export PS1="[\u@\h \W]\$ " will show the username, hostname, and current directory.

    2.	Add Colors to the Prompt:
     
     #	Use ANSI escape codes to add colors to the prompt. For example:

bash

Copy code

export PS1="\[\033[01;32m\]\u\[\033[00m\]@\[\033[01;34m\]\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;33m\]\w\[\033[00m\]$ "
This will color the username, hostname, and directory in green, blue, and yellow, respectively.

    3.	Add Additional Information:
     
     #	Include the current time or the exit status of the last command in the prompt.
     
     #	Example: export PS1="[\u@\h \w \$(date +'%T')]\$ " will add the time to the prompt.

####	Outcome: 
You will have a personalized command prompt that enhances usability and gives quick access to useful information.

alias grep='grep --color=auto'  # Enable color in grep results

    3.	Apply the Changes:
     
     #	Run source ~/.bashrc to load the new aliases.
    
    4.	Test Aliases:
     
     #	Use the alias to verify the command works as expected. For example, run ll and check if it lists files with long format.

####	Outcome: 
Learn to set up aliases to simplify command-line operations.

function disk_space() {

    df -h | sort -k 5 -n

}

    2.	Add Parameters to Functions:
     
     #	Add parameters to functions for flexibility.

#### 6. Task: Configuring Shell Startup Behavior

####	Objective: Learn how to configure shell startup behavior to automatically run scripts or commands when a shell session starts.

####	Task:

    1.	Edit ~/.bash_profile for Login Shell Behavior:
     
     #	Add commands to ~/.bash_profile that should run when a user logs in.
     
     #	Example: Automatically start a custom script:

bash

Copy code

if [ -f ~/startup.sh ]; then

    . ~/startup.sh

fi

    2.	Configure ~/.bashrc for Non-Login Shells:
     
     #	Ensure that ~/.bashrc runs for non-login shells. Use source ~/.bash_profile in ~/.bashrc to ensure login-related settings are applied to all sessions.

    3.	Test the Configuration:

#### 7. Task: Debugging and Troubleshooting Shell Profiles

####	Objective: 
Troubleshoot and debug issues related to shell profiles and environment settings.

####	Task:
    
    1.	Identify Misconfigurations:
     
     #	Use the echo command to check environment variables like PATH, EDITOR, PS1, etc.
     
     #	Check for syntax errors in ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile by running bash -n ~/.bashrc.
    
    2.	Log Shell Execution:
     
     #	Use set -x to trace the execution of commands in the shell profile files.
     
     #	Example: Add set -x at the beginning of ~/.bashrc to see each command as it's executed.
    
    3.	Resolve Common Problems:
    
     #	Fix issues like incorrect PATH settings or problems with loading custom scripts.
    
    4.	Check for Redundant Configuration:
     
     #	Ensure that ~/.bash_profile is not conflicting with ~/.bashrc. Typically, .bash_profile should source .bashrc to avoid duplication of configurations.
